# Tutti Colori

*A light theme for Nova*

**Tutti Colori** is taken from the default light theme from Kangacode's Espresso web editor (originally developed by MacRabbit). The colors and scoping try to stay faithful to the source. Deviations are mostly due to differences between Nova's syntax scoping and Espresso's, although there are a couple changes based on personal preference (most notably italicizing comments).

The theme has been tested so far with HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.

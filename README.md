# Tutti Colori for Nova

Tutti Colori is a light color scheme, original to Kangacode's [Espresso][1] web editor (originally developed by MacRabbit).

The colors and scoping mostly stay faithful to the original scheme, but while Nova and Espresso have similar theming engines they're not identical. There are ssome minor changes based on personal preference, most notably italicizing comments.

The theme has been tested with HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, PHP (including Advanced PHP), and Ruby.

The font used in the screenshot is MB Type's Triplicate Code.
